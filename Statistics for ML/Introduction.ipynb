    "### **1. Based on Measurement Levels**\n",
    "1. **Numerical (Quantitative Data)** - Represents measurable quantities (numbers).\n",
    "   - **Discrete Data**: Countable values (e.g., number of students, number of cars).\n",
    "   - **Continuous Data**: Measured values with infinite possibilities (e.g., height, weight, temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Categorical (Qualitative Data)** - Represents categories or labels.\n",
    "   - **Nominal Data**: Categories without any order (e.g., colors, gender, country names).\n",
    "   - **Ordinal Data**: Categories with a meaningful order (e.g., education level, customer satisfaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Based on Source**\n",
    "1. **Structured Data** - Organized in tables or databases (e.g., CSV files, SQL databases).\n",
    "2. **Unstructured Data** - No fixed format, such as text, images, videos.\n",
    "3. **Semi-structured Data** - Contains some structure but not fully organized (e.g., JSON, XML).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Based on Data Usage in Machine Learning**\n",
    "1. **Training Data** - Used to train the model.\n",
    "2. **Validation Data** - Used for tuning hyperparameters.\n",
    "3. **Test Data** - Used to evaluate model performance.\n",

    "### **2. Inferential Statistics**\n",
    "- Helps in making predictions or generalizations about a population using a sample.\n",
    "- Used to test hypotheses in machine learning.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - **Hypothesis Testing** (T-tests, Chi-square test)\n",
    "  - **Confidence Intervals** (Estimating population parameters)\n",
    "  - **Regression Analysis** (Predicting relationships between variables)\n",
